This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focuses on uncovering insights from FedEx Logistics' global supply chain dataset. The dataset encompasses detailed information on various aspects of logistics operations, including purchase orders (POs), shipment methods, vendor agreements (INCO terms), delivery schedules, and product-level data such as item descriptions and dosage forms. Given the complexity and scale of international logistics, the primary objective of this EDA is to support FedEx in enhancing supply chain efficiency, reducing operational costs, and ensuring timely deliveries.

The project also investigates vendor performance by comparing delivery timelines and fulfillment rates. This helps in identifying reliable vendors and those requiring closer monitoring or contract renegotiation. Furthermore, the dosage form and item description fields are assessed to identify any product-specific handling requirements that may influence shipping timelines or costs.

One of the critical goals of this analysis is to detect bottlenecks in the supply chain and recommend actionable solutions. These insights are especially crucial in the context of rising global eCommerce demand, where speed and reliability are essential to maintaining a competitive advantage. Through visualizations and statistical summaries, the EDA provides a comprehensive overview of how various factors interact and contribute to either operational efficiency or delays.

In conclusion, this EDA lays the groundwork for data-driven decision-making within FedEx Logistics. By highlighting inefficiencies and opportunities within the logistics network, it empowers the company to streamline operations, optimize shipment strategies, and improve customer satisfaction while effectively controlling freight costs.
